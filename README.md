# tic-tac-toe game with Q-learning

*Still work in progress*

I always wanted to learn how AI works, but most of the time I was discouraged by
the complexity shown in the tutorials and the amount of math that is required
to understand the approach the author took to solve the problem. For this
reason, I started writing a simple tic-tac-toe game from scratch and I will be
creating a smart AI opponent that should be able to beat me most of time ;)

To run the program, simply call:

```
python Main.py
```
